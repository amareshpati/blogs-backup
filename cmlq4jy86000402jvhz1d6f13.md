As developers, we keep discovering tools that quietly make our lives easier.  
Not flashy. Not hyped. Just… effective.

These are three tools I keep coming back to because they **remove friction from my workflow**.  
They save time, reduce mental load, and let me focus on building features instead of fighting setup, data, or formats.

## DummyJSON — An Instant Backend for Frontend Work

🔗 https://dummyjson.com

When I start working on a new feature, backend readiness is often the bottleneck.  
DummyJSON removes that problem entirely.

It gives you custom & ready-to-use REST APIs with realistic data — users, products, posts, todos, comments, and more — without any setup.

### Why it’s genuinely useful

- Create **custom APIs** using your own JSON  
- Ready endpoints like `/products`, `/users`, `/todos`, `/posts`  
- Full HTTP support: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`  
- Pagination, search, and filtering built in  
- Zero setup. Zero configuration.

### How it helps me

- I build UI and business logic without waiting on backend completion  
- I can test real-world scenarios like loading states and empty responses  
- No need to maintain mock servers or fake data generators  

Instead of guessing how data *might* look, I work with something close to production from day one.

## 📨 DummyInbox — Clean Email Testing Without Noise

🔗 https://dummyinbox.com

Testing email-based flows using your real inbox gets messy fast.  
DummyInbox fixes this with the simplest possible approach.

You get disposable email addresses instantly — no signup, no login, no tracking.

### Why I keep using it

- Instant temporary email addresses  
- Auto-expiring inboxes  
- No spam in personal or work email  
- Unlimited usage, completely free  

### Where it fits in my workflow

- Testing signup and onboarding flows  
- Verifying OTPs and confirmation emails  
- QA testing notification and alert emails  

It does one job — and does it really well.

## 🔍 JSON Crack — Making Sense of Messy JSON

🔗 https://jsoncrack.com/editor

If you work with APIs, you *will* deal with large, deeply nested JSON responses.  
JSON Crack turns that chaos into clarity.

Paste your JSON and instantly get a visual tree or graph of the structure.

### Features that actually matter

- Interactive visualization of JSON structures  
- Supports JSON, YAML, CSV, XML, TOML  
- Built-in formatter and validator  
- Easy format conversion  
- Export visuals for documentation or sharing  

### How I use it in real life

- Understand complex API responses copied from Postman  
- Debug unexpected nested fields quickly  
- Explain payload structures to teammates without long explanations  

Scrolling raw JSON is painful.  
Visualizing it saves time and mental energy.

## 🧠 Why These Tools Stick With Me

| Tool        | Problem Solved         | Real Impact                       |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| DummyJSON   | Backend dependency     | Faster frontend development       |
| DummyInbox  | Email testing clutter  | Clean QA, zero inbox pollution    |
| JSON Crack  | JSON complexity        | Faster debugging & understanding  |

They don’t replace thinking.  
They **remove unnecessary effort** — and that’s exactly what good tools should do.

## Final Note

I’ve tried many productivity tools.  
Most don’t survive daily usage.

These three did — because they solve real problems I face while building products.  
No hype. Just utility.

If you’re a frontend, mobile, or full-stack developer, chances are these tools will quietly improve your workflow too.
